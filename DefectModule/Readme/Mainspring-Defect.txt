Introduction:
--------------
- This Project is About the Defect module, which is present on the https://pratesting.cognizant.com website, MainSpring WebPage.
- This module allows us to create the Defects, add the details of defect, navigate to Workflow tab, Attachment tab, Comments tab, Activity Log tab, Previous Versions tab and automate all of them.
- This module allows us to create defects by filling fields in the UI.


Pre-requisites:
----------------
- The MainSpring which contains the Defect item module should be opened by the Authenticated user.
- URL for Mainspring : https://pratesting.cognizant.com


Technologies used:
-------------------
* The testScript is written in Java,with clean Syntax and comments with hard code free.
* Extent Report and logging is implemented with Screenshots .
* Data Driven testing is followed where the testdata is fetched from the excel file ,defect.xlsx.
* POM model is implemented where All the common methods are placed inside the config.properties and Page/Tab specific methods are stored in respective Util classes.
* Folder structure is maintained for better readability and maintenence.

Some of the implemented tools are Selenium,TestNG,Extent reporting using relavantcodes api, APache POI ,maven ,junit etc.
